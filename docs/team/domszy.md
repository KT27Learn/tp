### Project: LeadsForce

LeadsForce - LeadsForce is a client management software that was created to help student financial advisors to keep track of client information and client meetings. Outimised with a command-line interface (CLI), the application seeks to streamline the way financial advisors have been managing clients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Added several client attributes (Client ID and current financial plans)**:
  * Allows financial advisors to keep track of current financial plans, so that they can have a more comprehensive idea of the financial state of their clients
  * Client ID is used extensive throughout LeadsForce, such that commands no longer have to rely on the client list. 
  * Amended the `edit`, `add` commands to allow the app to take in these attributes

* **New Command: `Schedule`**
  * What it does: the command allows financial advisors to see the schedule of meetings they have with clients
  * Justification: For instance, if the client has many numerous meetings that's added into LeadsForce, they can simply use this command to determine the schedule of meetings that they have on the day.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the `edit` and `add` command to accomodate the new attributes in LeadsForce
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=t17&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Domszy&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
